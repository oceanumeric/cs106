## Trees 

Definition: node, edge, depth, height, root, parent, children;

Tree Traversal:

* inorder: left nodes -> root -> right nodes;
* preorder: root -> left nodes -> right nodes;
* postorder: left nodes -> root -> right nodes;

General Tree: each node can have as many children as it wants

Binary Tree: each parent node can have at most two children

* A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.

* A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.

* Balanced binary tree: the difference between the height of the left and the right subtree for each node is either 0 or 1.

__we focus on binary tree as it has very good properties__.
